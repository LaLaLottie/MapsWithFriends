# MapsWithFriends
This is a group class project (CS 440) and the files added are my contributions.  These files do not comprise of the whole project nor are the only files where I contributed code, but are the main ones.  The CardLayout6 file was contributed by other members of the group while the others are solely mine.  

This project is a game where players can travel around the world using Google Maps and the objective is to solve riddles/puzzles in order to guess the location the player was randomly placed at.  The player signs up/logs in and then is randomly placed in designated city somewhere in the world - landmarks and unique attractions on top of hints are shown so the player can guess where they are and thus win the game.
